    <h2 class="text--center">The problem</h2>
    <p class="text--center">Often, when developing/creating a new website, many intermediate versions of the static assets are created in order to achieve a given design.</p>
    <p>But when you need to share the staging work, people might already have a previous version of the file, so they will never get to see the changes without cleaning their browser's cache.</p>
    <p>And then you will need to ask people to clear their cache (?). Well, that's utter bullshit! Don't ever ask people to clear their cache!!! NEVER!!!</p>
    <p>NEVER!!!</p>
